# Motivation

With the rise of IoT, Industry 4.0 and the growing complexity of IT Systems in general, more and more time-stamped data is created. To store and organize these metrics, measurements and events, *Time Series Databases* are used. [ZEH]

In this scenario we want to take a closer look at *InfluxDB*, a schemaless time series database developed in the *Go* programming language. [ZEH]

**You will learn**:
-	The basic concepts behind InfluxDB
-	How to run InfluxDB using a docker image
-	How to model, write and query data in InfluxDB

Letâ€™s get started!
