Now that you know the technical backgrounds about InfluxDB and have learned how to model, write and query data using different interaction methods, you can start using InfluxDB in your projects.

The database offers a lot more features than shown in this scenario. Feel free to further explore the web UI or visit https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.0/ to learn more about what else InfluxDB has to offer. I recommend reading how to connect data sources for automatic data collection and how to visualize data using InfluxDB dashboards or Grafana.
