There are a lot of ways to interact with the InfluxDB server. Beside the HTTP API used by client libraries for languages like Go, C#, Python or Java, the two main methods are:

## Web Interface

The graphical user interface (UI) is accessed by navigating a web browser to the IP and Port the instance is running on. It can be used to configure data sources, explore and visualize data as well as set up tasks and alerts.

## Command Line

The command line interface (CLI) is called influx. Like the other options, it is used for managing aspects of InfluxDB and for writing and querying data.
