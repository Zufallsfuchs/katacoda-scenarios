There are a lot of methods to interact with the InfluxDB server. Beside the HTTP API used by client libraries for languages like Go, C#, Python or Java, the two main methods are:

## Web Interface

There is also a graphical user interface (UI) available by navigating a web browser to the IP and Port the instance is running on. It can be used to configure data sources, explore and visualize data as well as set up tasks and alerts. Weâ€™ll look at it later in this scenario.

## Command Line

The last option we will talk about is the command line interface (CLI) called influx. Like the other options, it is used to manage aspects of InfluxDB as well as write and query data. This will be the main method we use to interact with the database.
